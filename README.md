🐧 Linux: User and Group Management
In Linux, managing users and groups is essential for ensuring proper access control, file permissions, and overall system security.
📌 What is a User?

A user is an individual or entity that can log in and interact with the system. Each user has a unique user ID, home directory, and specific permissions.

📌 What is a Group?

A group is a collection of users. Groups allow system administrators to manage permissions for multiple users efficiently.

🔧 User Management Commands:
✅ Create a New User:

sudo adduser username

Or, to create a user without a home directory:

sudo useradd username
✅ Delete a User:

sudo deluser username

To delete the user along with their home directory:

sudo deluser --remove-home username

🔧 Group Management Commands

✅ Create a New Group:

sudo addgroup groupname

✅ Delete a Group:

sudo delgroup groupname

🔄 Add User to a Group

✅ Add an Existing User to a Group:

sudo usermod -aG groupname username

📌 -aG means append the user to the group(s), keeping existing group memberships.

✅ Check User's Group Memberships:
  
  groups username
